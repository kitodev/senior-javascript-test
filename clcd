Deployment in AWS:
Resource: AWS Lambda function for the FS class logic.

Why: Since the FS class is stateless and event-driven, Lambda is a good fit.
Resource: Amazon DynamoDB for storing the fileMap and contentMap.

Why: DynamoDB is a managed, serverless database that can scale automatically.
Resource: AWS API Gateway to expose the Lambda function.

Why: To provide HTTP access to the Lambda function.
Resource: AWS CodePipeline for CI/CD.

Why: To automate the build, test, and deployment phases.
Resource: AWS S3 Bucket.

Why: To store deployment artifacts.
Steps:
Code is pushed to GitHub.
AWS CodePipeline triggers on the new commit.
Code is built and tested.
If tests pass, the Lambda function is updated.
API Gateway exposes the new version.
